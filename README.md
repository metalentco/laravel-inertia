## Laravel React Inertia Tailwind starter kit

Includes Laravel Fortify for authentication

## Introduction

This starter kit provides a minimal and simple starting point for building a Laravel application with authentication. Styled with Tailwind. It also includes [Laravel Fortify](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/fortify) which publishes authentication controllers to your application that can be easily customized based on your own application's needs.

This starter is powered by React, Inertia, Tailwind and Laravel.

## How do I set this up

### Installation Via Composer

If your computer already has PHP and Composer installed, you may create a new project by using Composer directly.

```bash
composer create-project nwanguma/atlas your-project-name

npm install

npm run dev

cp .env.example .env

php artisan key:generate

php artisan storage:link
```

## To remove the documentation

-   windows
    ```bash
    rmdir /s docs
    del README.md
    echo "" > README.md
    ```
-   linux
    ```bash
    rm -r docs
    rm README.md
    touch README.md
    ```

## Just Reminders 😅

-   Make Hard Visits with

    ```
    Inertia::Location(route('login'));
    ```

    Good for those pages that require refresh of sessions, to avoid 419 error (Page Expired).

-   Global alias

    ```bash
    const path = require('path');

    .webpackConfig({
        resolve: {
            alias: {
                //making a global alias
                '@': path.resolve('resources/js')
            },
        },
    });
    ```

    I made a global alias '@' for absolute path imports.
